# 07: Disciplines

Disciplines are SFIO's extension mechanism — a singly-linked stack of
callback structs that intercept read, write, seek, and exception operations.
Each discipline mediates between the stream's buffer and the underlying
data source.

## Sfdisc_t structure

`Legacy: sfio.h:49-55`

```c
struct _sfdisc_s {
    Sfread_f    readf;      /* ssize_t (*)(Sfio_t*, void*, size_t, Sfdisc_t*) */
    Sfwrite_f   writef;     /* ssize_t (*)(Sfio_t*, const void*, size_t, Sfdisc_t*) */
    Sfseek_f    seekf;      /* Sfoff_t (*)(Sfio_t*, Sfoff_t, int, Sfdisc_t*) */
    Sfexcept_f  exceptf;    /* int (*)(Sfio_t*, int, void*, Sfdisc_t*) */
    Sfdisc_t*   disc;       /* next discipline in chain */
};
```

Any callback can be NULL — operations with NULL handlers pass through to
the next discipline (or to the raw syscall at the bottom).

`Polarity:` The discipline stack as a whole mediates between the stream's
buffer (value) and the OS (computation), with the structure of a polarity
boundary. Individual disciplines compose like morphisms within this pipeline —
they transform data at the same logical level (bytes → bytes). The stack's
endpoints define the boundary; the links are not individually shifts. The
exception is `_tmpexcept`, which has the structure of a genuine polarity shift:
it changes the computation substrate from memory to fd (see
[09-string-and-temp](09-string-and-temp.md)).

## SFDISC traversal macro

`Legacy: sfhdr.h:520-527`

```c
#define SFDISC(f,dc,iof) \
    { Sfdisc_t* d; \
      if(!(dc)) d = (dc) = (f)->disc; \
      else d = (f->bits&SFIO_DCDOWN) ? ((dc) = (dc)->disc) : (dc); \
      while(d && !(d->iof)) d = d->disc; \
      if(d) (dc) = d; \
    }
```

Walks the chain from `dc` (or `f->disc`) to find the first discipline with
a non-NULL handler for operation `iof` (readf/writef/seekf). If
`SFIO_DCDOWN` is set (inside a discipline callback), starts one step down
from the current discipline — this implements continuation-style dispatch.

---

## SFRD/SFWR/SFSK dispatch macros

`Legacy: sfhdr.h:528-542`

```c
#define SFDCRD(f,buf,n,dc,rv) \
    { int dcdown = f->bits&SFIO_DCDOWN; f->bits |= SFIO_DCDOWN; \
      rv = (*dc->readf)(f,buf,n,dc); \
      if(!dcdown) f->bits &= ~SFIO_DCDOWN; }
```

Sets SFIO_DCDOWN before calling the discipline, clears it after (unless it
was already set — handles nested discipline calls). Same pattern for
SFDCWR and SFDCSK.

`Contract:` SFIO_DCDOWN prevents the SFDISC macro from re-walking the chain
from the top — it skips to `dc->disc` instead, ensuring proper bottom-up
discipline traversal.

## sfdisc(f, disc) — push and pop

`Legacy: sfio/sfdisc.c:90-251`

### Query: sfdisc(f, (Sfdisc_t*)f)

Returns `f->disc` without modification.

### Push (disc != NULL, disc != SFIO_POPDISC)

1. Mode-normalize the stream.
2. `SFSYNC(f)` — flush/sync buffer.
3. If buffer has data (`n > 0`): notify both existing and incoming
   disciplines with `SFIO_DBUFFER` event. Return NULL if either returns
   negative (positive/zero means OK to proceed).
4. **Buffered-data cache** (read streams with readf): If there is unread
   data and the new discipline has a `readf`, create a `Dccache_t`
   temporary discipline containing a copy of the buffered bytes. Insert
   it **below** the new discipline:
   `f->disc → new-disc → Dccache → old-chain`.
   Its `readf` drains the cache; when exhausted, it self-removes and
   frees itself.
5. Notify current discipline: `(f->disc->exceptf)(f, SFIO_DPUSH, disc, f->disc)`.
   Handle the edge case where the current discipline pops itself in response.
6. Cycle check: walk chain, abort if `disc` already present.
7. Link: `disc->disc = f->disc; f->disc = disc`.
8. If effective read/write/seek functions changed: reinit buffer via `sfsetbuf()`.

### Pop (disc == NULL / SFIO_POPDISC)

1. Guard: if a `Dccache_t` is **directly below** the top discipline
   (`f->disc->disc->readf == _dccaread`), refuse to pop. A Dccache
   deeper in the chain does NOT trigger this guard.
2. Notify: `(d->exceptf)(f, SFIO_DPOP, d->disc, d)`. Return NULL if negative.
3. Unlink: `f->disc = d->disc`.
4. Return `d` (caller may free it).
5. Reinit check as with push.

### Dccache_t — temporary buffered-data discipline

`Legacy: sfio/sfdisc.c:42-88`

```c
typedef struct { Sfdisc_t disc; uchar *data; uchar *endb; } Dccache_t;
```

`_dccaread` serves cached bytes to the new discipline. When cache exhausted,
splices itself out of the chain and `free()`s itself. Ensures the new
discipline gets a seamless data stream including pre-push buffered data.

This solves a subtle ordering problem: without the cache, pushing a
discipline onto a read stream with buffered data would cause those bytes to
be re-read through the new discipline (which might transform them
differently the second time).

## _sfexcept — exception handler

`Legacy: sfio/sfexcept.c:25-122`

**Signature:** `int _sfexcept(Sfio_t *f, int type, ssize_t io, Sfdisc_t *disc)`

Called by read/write/seek primitives when an I/O operation returns ≤ 0.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| `type` | SFIO_READ (1), SFIO_WRITE (2), SFIO_SEEK (3) |
| `io` | Raw return: 0 = EOF, negative = error |
| `disc` | Discipline in use at point of failure |

### Return codes

| Code | Value | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| `SFIO_EDONE` | 0 | Stop operation, return what we have |
| `SFIO_EDISC` | 1 | Discipline handled it, resume |
| `SFIO_ESTACK` | 2 | Stack popped, retry on underlying stream |
| `SFIO_ECONT` | 3 | EINTR: clear error, retry syscall |

### Dispatch sequence

1. If local and `io <= 0`: set SFIO_ERROR or SFIO_EOF.
2. **Discipline exception call** (if `disc->exceptf`):
   - Call `ev = (*disc->exceptf)(f, type, &io, disc)`.
   - `ev < 0` → SFIO_EDONE.
   - `ev > 0` → SFIO_EDISC.
   - `ev == 0 && io > 0` → discipline refilled data, return ev.
   - Fall through if `ev == 0 && io <= 0`.
3. **String stream extension** (WRITE/SEEK, local, io ≥ 0):
   - `realloc(f->data, new_size)` rounded to SFIO_GRAIN.
   - Fix up `f->next` offset, update `f->data/endb/size`.
   - Return SFIO_EDISC (retry write into larger buffer).
4. **EINTR handling** (non-string):
   - If `_Sfexiting` or `f->bits & SFIO_ENDING` or `f->flags & SFIO_IOINTR`: SFIO_EDONE (don't retry).
   - Otherwise: clear errno and flags, return SFIO_ECONT.
5. **Stack auto-pop** (`chk_stack`):
   - If local, `f->push` set, buffer exhausted:
     - `pf = (*_Sfstack)(f, NULL)` — pop.
     - `sfclose(pf)`.
     - Return SFIO_ESTACK (retry on underlying).
   - Otherwise: SFIO_EDONE.

## Discipline stack as polarity boundary

The stack as a whole mediates between two representations (structural analogy
to SPEC.md's value/computation distinction — same failure discipline, but full
composition laws unverified):

- The **top** faces the stream's buffer (value-mode: the data
  that the buffer holds).
- The **bottom** faces the OS or another subsystem (computation-mode: the
  actual I/O operations).

Individual disciplines compose like morphisms within this pipeline — they
transform data at the same logical level (bytes → bytes). The stack's
endpoints define the analogue of a polarity boundary; each link is a
transformation step, not itself a shift. The exception is `_tmpexcept`, which
has the structure of a genuine polarity shift — swapping the computation
substrate from memory to fd (see
[09-string-and-temp](09-string-and-temp.md)).

### Dccache as non-associativity witness

The `Dccache_t` mechanism has the structure of a concrete instance of the
duploid non-associativity from SPEC.md §"Non-associativity made concrete."
When a discipline is pushed onto a stream with buffered data, those bytes
have already passed through the old discipline chain (computation → value
transformation complete). The new discipline expects to transform raw input.
Without the cache, the two bracketings yield different results:

```
f: raw I/O              positive (produces bytes from fd)
g: old discipline chain positive → negative (transforms bytes, computation context)
h: push-disc            negative (restructures the transformation pipeline)

(h ○ g) • f    push-disc and old-disc compose through negative intermediary
               (○, co-Kleisli — context restructuring), forming a combined
               pipeline. Raw I/O feeds into it through positive intermediary
               (•, Kleisli — data flow). New disc sees all data.

h ○ (g • f)    Old disc and raw I/O compose through positive intermediary
               (•, Kleisli — data flow), producing already-transformed
               buffered data. push-disc then restructures through negative
               intermediary (○). New disc doesn't see old data.
```

SPEC.md §"Tightening the analogies" differentiates three composition patterns
in the duploid: pipeline (•, positive/Kleisli intermediary), sequencing (○,
negative/co-Kleisli intermediary), and cut (⟨t|e⟩). The Dccache
non-associativity maps directly to the (+,−) equation failure
`(h ○ g) • f ≠ h ○ (g • f)`: data that has crossed to value mode via (•)
cannot be re-processed through a new (○) context without corruption. The
right bracketing is the broken one — data already transformed by the old
chain is invisible to the new discipline.

`Dccache_t` is the explicit mediator (analogous to SPEC.md's polarity frame)
that restores correct sequencing: it replays already-transformed bytes
without re-transforming them, then seamlessly hands off to the new discipline
chain for fresh data. (Structural analogy — the non-associativity pattern
matches, but the full duploid composition laws are unverified for sfio.)

### SFIO_DCDOWN traversal state

The `SFIO_DCDOWN` bit (in `f->bits`) tracks which direction we're traversing
the chain. Setting it on entry and clearing on exit follows the same
save/restore discipline as polarity frames (save, do work, restore), though
the state being managed is discipline traversal direction rather than
polarity-sensitive interpreter state.

---

## Key invariants

1. **Cycle-free**: sfdisc push checks for cycles. A discipline cannot appear
   twice in the same chain.

2. **Pre-push sync**: `SFSYNC(f)` before push ensures the new discipline
   doesn't see stale buffer state.

3. **Dccache preserves data ordering**: pushing a discipline with `readf`
   onto a read stream with buffered data doesn't lose or re-transform those
   bytes.

4. **SFIO_DCDOWN is transient**: set on entry to discipline callback, cleared
   on exit. Handles nesting correctly (saves/restores the bit).

5. **Discipline pop returns the discipline**: caller is responsible for
   freeing. SFIO does not free disciplines (they may be stack-allocated or
   shared).

returns. Typed function pointer aliases.
