# 03: Buffer Model

The buffer is the central abstraction in SFIO. Five pointers define a contiguous
memory region with separate read and write windows. Understanding their
invariants is prerequisite to understanding any SFIO operation.

## The five-pointer system

```
    _data                    _next        _endw/_endr     _endb
      |                        |              |              |
      v                        v              v              v
      +------------------------+--------------+--------------+
      |    consumed/written    |   available  |  slack space |
      +------------------------+--------------+--------------+

      |<------------ _size (may be larger) --------------->|
```

| Pointer | Type | Meaning |
|---------|------|---------|
| `_data` | `unsigned char*` | Base of buffer allocation |
| `_next` | `unsigned char*` | Current position (next byte to read or write) |
| `_endw` | `unsigned char*` | End of writable region |
| `_endr` | `unsigned char*` | End of readable region |
| `_endb` | `unsigned char*` | Physical end of buffer |

`Legacy: sfio_s.h:33-36, sfhdr.h:30-39`

## Fundamental invariant

```
Contract: _data <= _next <= min(_endr, _endw) <= _endb
```

This holds in the steady state. During mode transitions and lock states,
intermediate values may temporarily violate this (e.g., lock sets
`_endr = _endw = _data`).

## Read mode buffer lifecycle

When the stream is in `SFIO_READ` mode:

```
Active:   _endr = _endb (or end of valid data)
          _endw = _data (writes disabled)
          _next advances from _data toward _endr as bytes are consumed
```

1. **Fill**: When the buffer is empty, `_sffilbuf()` resets
   `_next = _endb = _endr = _data`, then reads into the buffer starting
   at `_data`. After the read: `_endb = _endr = _data + bytes_read`,
   `_next` stays at `_data`.
2. **Consume**: `sfgetc` / `sfread` advance `_next` toward `_endr`.
3. **Refill**: When `_next >= _endr`, the fast path falls through to
   `_sffilbuf()` which resets and refills.

The fast-path read macro:
```c
/* Legacy: sfio.h:298-299 */
#define __sf_getc(f) \
    (f->_next >= f->_endr ? _sffilbuf(f,0) : (int)(*f->_next++))
```

`Contract:` After a successful read, `_next` has advanced by the number of
bytes consumed. Data between `_data` and `_next` is consumed (may be
overwritten on next fill). Data between `_next` and `_endr` is available.

## Write mode buffer lifecycle

When the stream is in `SFIO_WRITE` mode:

```
Active:   _endw = _endb (fully buffered) or _endw = _data (line buffered)
          _endr = _data (reads disabled)
          _next advances from _data toward _endw as bytes are produced
```

1. **Produce**: `sfputc` / `sfwrite` place bytes at `_next` and advance it.
2. **Flush**: When `_next >= _endw`, `_sfflsbuf()` writes buffer to fd.
   Resets `_next = _data`.
3. **Produce**: Cycle repeats.

The fast-path write macro:
```c
/* Legacy: sfio.h:295-297 */
#define __sf_putc(f,c) \
    (f->_next >= f->_endw ? _sfflsbuf(f,(int)((unsigned char)(c))) : \
     (int)(*f->_next++ = (unsigned char)(c)))
```

### Line buffering trick

`Legacy: sfhdr.h:506`

```c
#define _SFOPENWR(f) ((f)->endw = ((f)->flags&SFIO_LINE) ? (f)->data : (f)->endb)
```

When `SFIO_LINE` is set, `_endw = _data`. This means every `sfputc` falls
through to `_sfflsbuf()`, which checks for newlines and flushes on `'\n'`.
The HIFORLINE threshold (128 bytes, `Legacy: sfhdr.h:552`) provides a
heuristic: if more than 128 bytes are being written at once, the slow path
skips the line-scan and does a bulk write.

## Mode switching

`Legacy: sfmode.c via _sfmode(f, mode, local)`

When switching between read and write (or vice versa), the buffer must be
reconciled:

**Read → Write**:
- Unconsumed read data (`_next` to `_endr`) represents bytes that were
  read from the fd but not consumed. The fd's logical position must be
  adjusted backward by seeking: `f->here -= (f->endb - f->next)`.
- Buffer is then reset for writing: `_next = _data`, `_endr = _data`,
  `_endw = _endb` (or `_data` if line-buffered).

**Write → Read**:
- Pending write data (`_data` to `_next`) must be flushed via `_sfflsbuf()`.
- Buffer is then reset for reading: `_next = _data = _endr` (empty, will
  fill on next read).

`Polarity:` Mode switching has the structure of a polarity boundary crossing —
it restructures the buffer's role from value-producing (write) to
value-consuming (read) or vice versa. This is not a cut in SPEC.md's sense
(connecting a producer to a consumer) but a mode transition within the
stream's own state. The seek/flush is the cost of reconciling the two modes.

## Lock state

`Legacy: sfhdr.h:504`

```c
#define SFLOCK(f,l) (void)((f)->mode |= SFIO_LOCK, (f)->endr = (f)->endw = (f)->data)
```

When locked:
- `_endr = _endw = _data`
- Fast-path macros always see `_next >= _endr` (or `_next >= _endw`), so
  they call the slow path
- Slow path checks `SFIO_LOCK` and returns error/EOF

```c
#define SFOPEN(f,l) (void)((l) ? 0 : \
    ((f)->mode &= ~(SFIO_LOCK|SFIO_RC|SFIO_RV), _SFOPEN(f), 0))
```

Unlock restores `_endr`/`_endw` via `_SFOPEN(f)` based on exact mode equality:
- `mode == SFIO_READ`: `_endr = _endb`
- `mode == SFIO_WRITE`: `_endw = _endb` (or `_data` if line-buffered)
- Otherwise (mode has extra bits): `_endr = _endw = _data`

⚠ Hazard: This is exact equality, not flag-test. A stream with
`mode == SFIO_WRITE|SFIO_STRING` hits the else branch.

`Contract:` Every public SFIO function locks on entry, unlocks on exit. The
SETLOCAL/GETLOCAL mechanism (`Legacy: sfhdr.h:483-484`) ensures only the
outermost (non-recursive) call actually unlocks.

## SFIO_PEEK state

Set by `sfreserve()` when it returns a pointer to buffer data without
consuming it. While SFIO_PEEK is set:

- The returned pointer is valid — the buffer won't be refilled
- Stream access is frozen (`SFFROZEN()` returns true for SFIO_PEEK)
- The peek is released by a subsequent `sfread()` with `n == 0` or another
  `sfreserve()` call

`Legacy: sfhdr.h:165` — `SFIO_PEEK 00000400`

`Polarity:` SFIO_PEEK has the structure of a thunk (↓N): a computation
(the stream's fill/read machinery) is suspended into a storable value (a
pointer + length) that must be explicitly forced (via `sfread(f, buf, 0)` or
another `sfreserve`). SPEC.md §"Tightening the analogies" distinguishes
thunks (↓N, lazy — deferred until first access) from futures (↓N, eager —
started immediately). Process substitution (`<(cmd)`) is a future; SFIO_PEEK
is a genuine thunk — data sits in the buffer without advancing until forced.
The ↓N label captures the polarity structure in both cases; for SFIO_PEEK it
also captures the evaluation strategy (lazy), making this one of the closer
matches between sfio and the formal framework.

## String stream buffer

For `SFIO_STRING` streams (`_file == -1`):

- Buffer is heap-allocated, resizable
- `_data` points to the allocation, `_endb = _data + allocated_size`
- Write past `_endb` triggers a WRITE exception → discipline handler
  extends the buffer via realloc
- No fd I/O — all operations are in-memory
- `sfstruse(f)` NUL-terminates and returns `_data`, resetting `_next`

The string stream extent tracking macro:
```c
/* Legacy: sfhdr.h:555-558 */
#define SFSTRSIZE(f) { Sfoff_t s = (f)->next - (f)->data; \
    if(s > (f)->here) \
        { (f)->here = s; if(s > (f)->extent) (f)->extent = s; } \
}
```

`here` tracks the high-water mark within the current session; `extent`
tracks the all-time maximum. Both are used to determine how much data to
copy during string→file promotion in `sftmp()`.

## Mmap buffer

When `SFIO_MMAP` is set in `bits` (and `MAP_TYPE` is available):

- Buffer is a memory-mapped region of the file
- `_data` points to the mapping, `_endb = _data + mapped_size`
- `SFIO_NMAP` pages mapped at a time (1024 on 64-bit, 32 on 32-bit)
- Unmapping via `SFMUNMAP(f, addr, size)` zeros all five pointers
- `madvise(MADV_SEQUENTIAL)` / `MADV_NORMAL` for access pattern hints

`Legacy: sfhdr.h:434-467`

## Direct I/O

When a request is large enough relative to the buffer, SFIO bypasses the
buffer and does I/O directly to/from the caller's memory:

```c
/* Legacy: sfhdr.h:431-432 */
#define SFDIRECT(f,n) (((ssize_t)(n) >= (f)->size) || \
    ((n) >= SFIO_GRAIN && (ssize_t)(n) >= (f)->size/16))
```

A request qualifies for direct I/O if it's at least as large as the buffer,
or at least 1024 bytes and at least 1/16th of the buffer size. This avoids
the double-copy overhead for bulk transfers.

## Buffer sizing

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `SFIO_BUFSIZE` | 8192 | Default buffer size |
| `SFIO_GRAIN` | 1024 | Minimum allocation granularity |
| `SFIO_PAGE` | `1024 * sizeof(int) * 2` | Page-sized allocation unit |

`Legacy: sfhdr.h:425-426`

→ C23: Inline accessor functions with `[[nodiscard]]` for buffer queries.
Bounds-checked helpers for pointer arithmetic. `constexpr` for size constants.

## Fast peek macros

```c
/* Legacy: sfhdr.h:545-549 */
#define _SFAVAIL(f,s,n) ((n) = (f)->endb - ((s) = (f)->next))
#define SFRPEEK(f,s,n)  (_SFAVAIL(f,s,n) > 0 ? (n) : \
    ((n) = SFFILBUF(f,-1), (s) = (f)->next, (n)))
#define SFWPEEK(f,s,n)  (_SFAVAIL(f,s,n) > 0 ? (n) : \
    ((n) = SFFLSBUF(f,-1), (s) = (f)->next, (n)))
```

Internal fast path: check if buffer has data (read) or space (write). If not,
trigger fill/flush and retry. Returns available byte count in `n` and buffer
pointer in `s`.

⚠ Hazard: `_SFAVAIL` uses `_endb - _next`, not `_endr - _next`. For reads,
this considers all physically buffered bytes, including past a NUL-replaced
separator. Code that needs only the readable extent should check `_endr`.

## Polarity analysis

The buffer mediates between two modes that have the structure of polarities
(structural analogy — same shape as SPEC.md's value/computation distinction,
same failure discipline, but full composition laws unverified):

- **Value** (the data): what's stored between `_data` and `_next` (written) or
  between `_next` and `_endr` (readable). This is the *content*.
- **Computation** (the I/O): syscalls that move data between buffer and fd.
  Triggered when the buffer boundary is hit (read exhausted or write full).

The five pointers encode both the value extent (data range) and the
computation state (where in the fill/flush cycle we are), giving them the
structure of a polarity boundary. Lock state freezes this boundary; mode
switching has the character of a polarity reversal that must reconcile both
sides.
